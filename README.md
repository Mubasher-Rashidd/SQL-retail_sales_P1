# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `retail_db`

This project demonstrates SQL skills and techniques commonly used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. It involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions using SQL queries. This is an ideal project for those beginning their journey in data analysis and looking to build a solid foundation in SQL.

## Objectives

**Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database using the available dataset.
**Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove records with missing or null values.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct basic exploratory data analysis to better understand the dataset.
**Business Analysis**: Use SQL queries to answer key business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project begins by creating a database named `retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Count the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Determine how many unique customers exist in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: List all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Identify any null values in the dataset and remove records with missing data.

```sql
-- Count the total number of records in the dataset
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;

-- Count the number of unique customers in the dataset

-- List all unique product categories in the dataset
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

-- Identify records with missing or null values
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

-- Remove records with missing or null values
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND
    quantity >= 4
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP
    BY
    category,
    gender
ORDER BY 1
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:

```sql
SELECT
       year,
       month,
    avg_sale
FROM
(
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
    AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales**:

```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:

```sql
WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion
